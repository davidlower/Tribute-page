# Tribute-page
My first project with Freecodecamp. A tribute page. Dedicated to Andrew Taylor Still - the founder of Osteopathy. My first ever attempt at coding.

I uploaded it first without any responsiveness.
I then spent a week learning responsiveness. I converted all my values to either 'rem' or percentages. Then I turned it into a fluid design with a few media queries for true responsiveness.
