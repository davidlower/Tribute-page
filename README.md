# Tribute-page
My first project with Freecodecamp. A tribute page.

I uploaded it first without any responsiveness.
I then spent a week learning responsiveness. I convert all my values to either 'rem' or percentages. Then I turn it into a fluid design with a few media queries for true responsiveness.
